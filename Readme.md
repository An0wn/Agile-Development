### Course 1: Agile Meets Design Thinking

https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-getting-started-agile/home/info

Despite everyone's good intentions, hard work and solid ideas, too many projects end up creating unneeded, unusable, and unsellable products. But it doesn't have to be this way. Agile and design thinking offer a different--and effective--approach to product development, one that results in valuable solutions to meaningful problems. In this course, you’ll learn how to determine what's valuable to a user early in the process--to frontload value--by focusing your team on testable narratives about the user and creating a strong shared perspective. 

We’ll show you how to:
- Explain key concepts and practices from the agile product development methodology
- Create a strong shared perspective and drive to value using personas and problem scenarios
- Diagnose what software to develop and why using a set of agile user stories and prototypes
- Facilitate narrative collaboration with user stories and prototypes 
- Allow for early testing and validation by analyzing and deciding on story backlogs

### Course 2: Running Product Design Sprints

https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-running-design-sprints/home/info

Typically, clients and managers don't want to pay for design (or strategy) -- they want ‘results’! Too often, this leads to solutions that just don’t make sense and aren’t valuable to anyone. 
 
Design sprints allow you to meet client's desire for quick, specific outcomes while making time to do things right. In this course, you’ll learn how to plan and run situation-appropriate sprints to avoid waste and deliver value sooner. 
 
We'll show you how to: 
- Plan, sell, and conduct design sprints that deliver valuable, actionable insights
- Go out and learn who your customer really is and what’s important to them
- Test your value propositions before you invest in building solutions
- Test your user interface design to make sure it’s really usable
- Focus and drive to actionable conclusions on questions of approach and architecture

### Course 3: Managing an Agile Team

https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-agile-team-management/home/info

Traditional development processes often lead to team frustration and poor results. Agile offers a different approach to managing the complexity of software development. This course focuses on the day-to-day jobs of running a software development program and how leading agile methodologies (Scrum, XP, kanban) can help you do them better. 

From transitioning a team to agile to running sprints to managing stakeholders, this course gives you the skills you need to manage an agile team in your specific operating environment. 

We'll show you how to: 
- Think through and focus on the most important aspects of your projects and sprints
- Facilitate your team’s initial and ongoing adoption of the specific agile practices that work for you
- Anchor your outcomes and success criteria in durable ideas about what makes for valuable products
- Support your team's transition from traditional approaches to agile 
- Create an agile-friendly environment across functional disciplines
- Identify and manage outside stakeholder needs

### Course 4: Testing with Agile

https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-agile-testing/home/info

To deliver agile outcomes, you have to do more than implement an agile process; you have to create a culture of experimentation. It's this commitment to experimenting that's at the heart of a high-functioning practice  of agile. This course shows you how to integrate the practice of experimentation across concept/feature testing, usability testing, and testing the software itself. 

Basically, you’ll learn how to answer these four big questions with experiments: 
1. Should we build it? 
2. Did it matter?
3. Is it usable?
4. Did it break?

More specifically, after completing this course, you’ll be able to: 
  - Identify where and how to invest your team’s scarce time and energy into better testing for maximum impact on outcomes
  - Coach your team on the relationship between idea, usability, and software testing to get the buy-in you need for strong 
    interdisciplinary collaboration
  - Test ideas before you build them to avoid waste and help your team focus on what will really drive outcomes
  - Test alternative interface patterns before you build them to maximize both product usability and purposeful 
    implementation
  - Understand your delivery pipeline and how to prioritize process and infrastructure improvements so you can deliver faster 
    and more often

### Course 5: Agile Development in Practice (Project-centered Course)

https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-agile-development-capstone/home/info

This project-centered course provides a guided opportunity for you to practice your agile development skills. Using the venture design process that frames the four courses in this Specialization, you will apply agile processes to a project of your choice or to a provided venture concept. From persona, problem scenario, and user story development to designing user testing and product launch, you’ll practice leading an agile project. You’ll finish the course with a portfolio-building design brief that demonstrates your learning and specialized skills in agile product development.

To get the most out of this course, we suggest you first complete the other four courses in the Agile Development Specialization (Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking; Running Product Design Sprints, Managing an Agile Team, Testing with Agile). 

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
--Formulate foundational positioning statements
--Create, refine and test actionable personas
--Conduct user interviews and analyze the results
--Determine a 'happy path' to quickly test user stories
--Run motivation and usability testing and evaluate the results
